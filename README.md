Gjallarhorn transliterates runes into Roman letters so that you can try to decipher a message from an old relic, inscribe Norse curse words onto bathroom stalls, or just send psudo-cryptographic messages to your friend.

Gjallarhorn transliterates Elder Futhark, Younger Futhark, and Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. The runic alphabets have been designed to transliterate to Old Norse, Old English, and Modern English, though you may find luck with others.

If you have even the slightest critique please report it in the issues tab. Issues are cool, they make me feel like I know what I'm doing.



# How to Use It #

Every transliteration goes something like this:
- In the first combo box, select whether you are transliterating to or from runes.
- In the second combo box, decide which runes you are transliterating to or from.
- Transliteration will appear in the output textbox. In there you can edit the output, dechipher characters with alternative transliterations, and etc.
- Your next transliteration is only a clear button away.

If you want your output formatted a certain way, see the settings menu for some postprocessing options.
