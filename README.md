Notes:
- This is a very early phase of this tool, and I made this in two weeks for a friend.
  So just keep in mind that everything is subject to change in the future.

- The program supports three alphabets to translate into and out of Elder Futhark runes,
  Anglo Saxon runes, and Medieval runes. This tool should be able to translate any runes
  you find on a rock or something to english characters, but say something if it doesn't.

- Some runes do not perfectly match up to a letter, so when that happens the sound is
  aproximated. Example: Q might be approximated to (cu)

- Trying to put in extremely long string of text may result in a crash. (Other than that
  it works well though.)
  
- The build can be found in the release file.
