Info:
- This program can convert all the runic languages they have Unicoe symbols for
  into english (I think the proper term is roman) characters. 
  
- If you are translating english characters into runes then there are a few
  extra steps you may need to take to get a perfect runic conversion. To find
  out more about what I mean, check this out:

- Any runes you find on old rocks or something probably will need to be
  translated from old norse to english. For when you need to do that, this is
  great: http://www.vikingsofbjornstad.com/Old_Norse_Dictionary_E2N.shtm
